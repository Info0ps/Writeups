We have a linux binary and after inspection its a flag checker

Ghidra decompiler output shows this massive block with variable referenced and xor'd and copied, This would be the encryption logic for our checker
```c
if (uVar7 == 56) {
    local_38 = local_58;
    uVar4 = 0;
    while( true ) {
        bVar17 = local_58[uVar4];
        bVar12 = local_58[uVar4 + 1];
        bVar10 = local_58[uVar4 + 2];
        bVar5 = local_58[uVar4 + 3];
        bVar9 = local_58[uVar4 + 4];
        bVar11 = local_58[uVar4 + 5];
        bVar18 = local_58[uVar4 + 6];
        bVar6 = local_58[uVar4 + 7];
        iVar14 = 0;
        do {
            uVar16 = (ulong)bVar17;
            uVar7 = (ulong)bVar12;
            uVar8 = (ulong)bVar10;
            uVar3 = (ulong)bVar9;
            bVar13 = (byte)iVar14;
            bVar17 = (&DAT_00104050)[bVar18] ^ bVar13;
            bVar12 = (&DAT_00104050)[uVar16] ^ bVar13;
            bVar10 = (&DAT_00104050)[bVar6] ^ bVar13;
            bVar5 = (&DAT_00104050)[bVar5] ^ bVar13;
            bVar9 = (&DAT_00104050)[uVar7] ^ bVar13;
            bVar11 = (&DAT_00104050)[bVar11] ^ bVar13;
            bVar18 = (&DAT_00104050)[uVar8] ^ bVar13;
            bVar6 = (&DAT_00104050)[uVar3] ^ bVar13;
            iVar14 = iVar14 + 1;
        } while (iVar14 != 0x1000);
        if (((((bVar17 != (&DAT_00102010)[uVar4]) || (bVar12 != (&DAT_00102011)[uVar4])) ||

        uVar4 = uVar4 + 8;
        if (0x37 < uVar4) {
            puts("Correct flag methinks.");

```

debugging shows us all these variables are bytes from our input which needs to be 55 characters. It gets 8 bytes from our input, makes a copy of some to prevent using a variable after overwriting it, uses the ulong cast to find the offset in a data set, xor's the referenced byte with a loop count for 4096 times, before checking if the 8 bytes are correct and match a key/ the encrypted flag

I find it easier to reverse in python than C or ASM so i recreated the encryption process in python first
```py
import copy

def encrypt(group:list[int]):
    byte = copy.copy(group)
    tmp = copy.copy(group)

    for i in range(4096):
        tmp[0] = key[byte[6]] ^ i
        tmp[1] = key[byte[0]] ^ i
        tmp[2] = key[byte[7]] ^ i
        tmp[3] = key[byte[3]] ^ i
        tmp[4] = key[byte[1]] ^ i
        tmp[5] = key[byte[5]] ^ i
        tmp[6] = key[byte[2]] ^ i
        tmp[7] = key[byte[4]] ^ i
        for j in range(8):
            byte[j] = tmp[j] % 0x100

    return byte
```

We need to get the data that the program uses otherwise our lookup doesnt work, so i dumped the data at the address while the binary was running. this goes above the function so that it knows what data it 

```py
key = [0x63,0x7c,0x77,0x7b,0xf2,0x6b,0x6f,0xc5,0x30,0x01,0x67,0x2b,0xfe,0xd7,0xab,0x76,0xca,0x82,0xc9,0x7d,0xfa,0x59,0x47,0xf0,0xad,0xd4,0xa2,0xaf,0x9c,0xa4,0x72,0xc0,0xb7,0xfd,0x93,0x26,0x36,0x3f,0xf7,0xcc,0x34,0xa5,0xe5,0xf1,0x71,0xd8,0x31,0x15,0x04,0xc7,0x23,0xc3,0x18,0x96,0x05,0x9a,0x07,0x12,0x80,0xe2,0xeb,0x27,0xb2,0x75,0x09,0x83,0x2c,0x1a,0x1b,0x6e,0x5a,0xa0,0x52,0x3b,0xd6,0xb3,0x29,0xe3,0x2f,0x84,0x53,0xd1,0x00,0xed,0x20,0xfc,0xb1,0x5b,0x6a,0xcb,0xbe,0x39,0x4a,0x4c,0x58,0xcf,0xd0,0xef,0xaa,0xfb,0x43,0x4d,0x33,0x85,0x45,0xf9,0x02,0x7f,0x50,0x3c,0x9f,0xa8,0x51,0xa3,0x40,0x8f,0x92,0x9d,0x38,0xf5,0xbc,0xb6,0xda,0x21,0x10,0xff,0xf3,0xd2,0xcd,0x0c,0x13,0xec,0x5f,0x97,0x44,0x17,0xc4,0xa7,0x7e,0x3d,0x64,0x5d,0x19,0x73,0x60,0x81,0x4f,0xdc,0x22,0x2a,0x90,0x88,0x46,0xee,0xb8,0x14,0xde,0x5e,0x0b,0xdb,0xe0,0x32,0x3a,0x0a,0x49,0x06,0x24,0x5c,0xc2,0xd3,0xac,0x62,0x91,0x95,0xe4,0x79,0xe7,0xc8,0x37,0x6d,0x8d,0xd5,0x4e,0xa9,0x6c,0x56,0xf4,0xea,0x65,0x7a,0xae,0x08,0xba,0x78,0x25,0x2e,0x1c,0xa6,0xb4,0xc6,0xe8,0xdd,0x74,0x1f,0x4b,0xbd,0x8b,0x8a,0x70,0x3e,0xb5,0x66,0x48,0x03,0xf6,0x0e,0x61,0x35,0x57,0xb9,0x86,0xc1,0x1d,0x9e,0xe1,0xf8,0x98,0x11,0x69,0xd9,0x8e,0x94,0x9b,0x1e,0x87,0xe9,0xce,0x55,0x28,0xdf,0x8c,0xa1,0x89,0x0d,0xbf,0xe6,0x42,0x68,0x41,0x99,0x2d,0x0f,0xb0,0x54,0xbb,0x16,0xa0,0x25,0xcb,0xf7,0xff,0x7f,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00]
```

Reversing the python code is a reasonable swap from offset lookups to getting the index where a value is
```py
def decrypt(chunk:list[int]) -> list[int]:
    byte = copy.copy(chunk)
    tmp = copy.copy(chunk)

    for i in range(0,4096):
        i = 4096-i -1
        # print(i)
        tmp[6] = key.index((byte[0] ^ i) % 0x100 )
        tmp[0] = key.index((byte[1] ^ i) % 0x100 )
        tmp[7] = key.index((byte[2] ^ i) % 0x100 )
        tmp[3] = key.index((byte[3] ^ i) % 0x100 )
        tmp[1] = key.index((byte[4] ^ i) % 0x100 )
        tmp[5] = key.index((byte[5] ^ i) % 0x100 )
        tmp[2] = key.index((byte[6] ^ i) % 0x100 )
        tmp[4] = key.index((byte[7] ^ i) % 0x100 )
        for j in range(8):
            byte[j] = tmp[j] % 0x100

    return byte
```

Get the bytes that are compared in the if statement at the end of the binary, in this case since my function only takes an 8 byte array, I made an array of 8 byte arrays to decrypt
```py
chunk = [[0x16, 0x2d, 0x79, 0xca, 0x56, 0xc6, 0x65, 0xe9,],
[0xe9, 0x16, 0x66, 0x23, 0x09, 0x2d, 0x1b, 0x09,],
[0x1c, 0x09, 0xc6, 0x1c, 0x1f, 0xad, 0xe9, 0xda,],
[0xa0, 0xc6, 0x1a, 0x66, 0x09, 0xad, 0x81, 0x1c,],
[0x80, 0x39, 0xa0, 0x21, 0x09, 0x65, 0x2d, 0x30,],
[0xf6, 0x57, 0xf6, 0xa2, 0x65, 0x65, 0x21, 0xa2,],]

for byte in chunk:
    byte = decrypt(byte)
    string = "".join([chr(x) for x in byte])
    print(string,end="")
```

Now with everything in place running the script prints our flag "x3c{pwndbg_and_pwntools_my_belowed_573498532832}"
