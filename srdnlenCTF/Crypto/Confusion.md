## TL;DR of the source code
Given an encryption scheme that will encrypt your input. Given an encrypted flag, find the decrypted flag

## Solution
At first we may thought it was a known plaintext attack. But because of the initial random block, this attack is not feasible. Instead, we can solve it using an oracle attack. It essentially just bruteforcing the flag from left to right by checking if the value of encrypted inputs at a specific block is the same. In this case, we compare the value of encrypted 'zeros' made from zero strings and encrypted 'test' made from zero strings, known piece of flag, and a character we bruteforcing in hexadecimal 

Now we have 2 problems. How long is the flag, and how to make the encryption rounds XOR-ed with zero bytes

For the latter, we can just set the first n blocks with zero strings. This will make the 4th - nth block of encrypted input an encrypted zero string (remember that the 1st block is random byte).
As for the former, we can try some inputs with different length and note when the encrypted message lengthen. Then we know that the flag length is 53 bytes (note that the padded plaintext length = ciphertext length in AES). This means that, initially, we need to have 'zeros' to be at least 5 block plus 3 block (because the decrypted encrypted zero string starts from the third block at the decryption round) of zero strings

Here is the solver script
```
from pwn import *
from Crypto.Util.number import *

p = remote('confusion.challs.srdnlen.it', 1338)

#function to send input
def sends(payload):
    print(payload)
    p.sendlineafter(b'(hex) ', payload)
    p.recvuntil(b'encryption:\n|\n')
    ans = p.recvline()[4:].decode()
    return ans

flag = b''
for j in range(69):
    #128 (8 block) - 1 bytes of zero strings in hexadecimal 
    zeros = '00' * (127-j)
    test = zeros
    enczeros = sends(zeros)
    for i in range(256):
        hexi = hex(i)[2:]
        if len(hexi)<2:
            hexi = '0' + hexi
        test = test + flag.hex() + hexi
        enctest = sends(test)
        #Here we compare the (8+1)th block of encrypted message because test is 8 block and the prepended random bytes is 1 block long
        if enczeros[256:288] == enctest[256:288]:
            flag = flag + long_to_bytes(i)
            break
    print(flag)

print(flag)
```
###### a fun part is when you realize the input is padded 2 times instead of once

Flag : srdnlen{I_h0p3_th15_Gl4ss_0f_M1rt0_w4rm3d_y0u_3n0ugh}
