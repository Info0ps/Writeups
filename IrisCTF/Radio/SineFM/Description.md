While browsing the radio spectrum, I found this interesting radio channel on 434.677 MHz with some intermittent activity. I'm having some trouble making sense of it, but I'm fairly certain that this is being used as some sort of communications channel. Can you find out what's being transmitted?

 

Note: while not required, it's highly recommended that you do RFoIP before you do this challenge. This challenge is a bit more difficult than RFoIP, and RFoIP will give you a good foundation for understanding this challenge.
