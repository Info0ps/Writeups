The challenge dotdotdot is pretty straight forward.

The challenge gives you a .iq file. We can import the Raw data in the software audacity. When i started listening to the audio. I could heard morse code. At first, I tried to isolate the morse code so i could pass it to an online decoder, but there was too much white noise. 

I checked the spectrogram to see if i can find the morse code.

  I then watched a video on how to read morse code signal. I then converted the signal by hand 

.. .-. .. ... -.-. - ..-.  -. ----- .---- ... ...--  --. ----- -  -. ----- - .... .---- -. --.  ----- -.  -- -.--  -- ----- .-. ... .

the dot and the dash in the spectrogram are the same in there text equivalent. If there's two space its a symbol 

Converting that to text we get :

IRISCTFN01S3G0TN0TH1NG0NMYM0RSE -> irisctf{n01s3_g0t_n0th1ng_0n_my_m0rse}
